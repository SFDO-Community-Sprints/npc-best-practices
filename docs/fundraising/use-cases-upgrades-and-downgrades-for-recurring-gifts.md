# Upgrades and Downgrades for Recurring Gifts


**Definition:**

Represented by changes in the recurring gift record, including updated amounts and payment schedules. Additionally, a change history log tracks modifications, providing transparency and maintaining donor communication. See [Upgrade or Downgrade a Recurring Gift Commitment](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sfdo.npc_fr_upgrade_downgrade_recurring_gift_commitment.htm&type=5) on Salesforce Help for more.

**Upgrades for Recurring Gifts**: This refers to the process of increasing the amount, frequency, or duration of a donor's recurring gift. An upgrade indicates that a donor is willing to contribute more to support the organisation, reflecting increased engagement or capacity.

**Downgrades for Recurring Gifts**: This involves reducing the amount, frequency, or duration of a donor's recurring gift.

**Examples:**


1.     Upgrade of Recurring Gift:
Scenario : A donor is currently contributing $50 monthly to your organisation.
* Current Recurring Gift: $50/month
* Upgrade: Jane decides to increase her contribution to $75/month.
* Action:
    * Locate Janeâ€™s recurring gift record in Salesforce.
    * Click on the Upgrade|Downgrade action button in the upper right corner of the page.
    * Select the corresponding Gift Commitment Schedule - make sure it is the active one if there is more than one.
    * Follow the wizard and update the amount to the new higher amount as well as the Effective Start Date for the upgraded donation.
    * Click Continue and Save.
    * Notify donor via email, thanking her for her increased support and confirming the new contribution amount. 
2.     Downgrade of Recurring Gift:
Scenario: Another donor has been contributing $100 quarterly but needs to reduce his commitment.
* Current Recurring Gift: $100/quarter
* Downgrade: John requests to change his contribution to $75/quarter.
* Action
    * Find John's recurring gift records in Salesforce.
    * Follow the same process as you did above for upgrading a donation, this time lowering the amount.
    * Reach out to donor, expressing gratitude for his continued support.

 Note that with Nonprofit Cloud, you also have action buttons to Pause and Resume a Gift Commmitment for cases where a donor needs to temporarily suspend their giving.
