**Definition:**



* Repeating gift with a set schedule

* Same payment amount every time, though payment could be increased or decreased  by the donor at some point
* Generally open-ended - the donations continue to come in until the donor cancels or the credit card expires/is declined

**Examples:**



* Automatic credit card charge through a donation platform for the same amount each month
* Donor sends in a check every month

**Not using Opportunity because:**



* Tracking solicitation is not necessary
