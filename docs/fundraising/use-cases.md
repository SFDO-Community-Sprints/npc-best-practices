# Fundraising Use Cases
For nonprofits, incoming monies arrive in various ways and can be recorded in a variety of ways. The Fundraising Use Cases on these pages are meant as a guide to help nonprofits understand how to record and track incoming monies in Salesforce's Nonprofit Cloud. We recognize that there may be nuances and customization needed depending on how your nonprofit's processes work.

# Overall Considerations
## Gift Transactions
* A Gift Transaction status can be changed, but some restrictions depend on the current status. For example, a Paid Gift Transaction can only be updated to 'Failed' or 'Fully Refunded'. [Review the documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sfdo.npc_fr_gift_transactions.htm&type=5) for a complete list of allowed status updates.

## Gift Commitments
* When using Gift Entry to indicate that a Gift Transaction was paid against an existing Gift Commitment with a Gift Commitment Schedule, note that only one payment can be recorded per Gift Transaction.
    * A Gift Transaction will autoname to the commitment amount, even if the entry amount is different (based on default).
    * Once Gift Entry has processed the Gift Transaction, any edits will require multiple steps and manipulation of the Gift Transaction status.
    * Once a Gift Commitment is applied to a Gift Entry, it cannot be removed (Gift Processing Status = Success).
    * In order for the Gift Commitment to appear in Gift Entry, it must meet the following criteria:
  
         * Effective Start Date must be populated
         * Status must be Active
         * Gift Received Date needs to be within the Installment Extension Day Count window (set in the Fundraising Settings) for the Transaction Due Date for the next scheduled Gift Transaction.

## Gift Entry
* Starting in the Spring '25 release, you can [map custom fields for Gift Entry](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_fundraising_improve_donor_relations_and_track_the_impact_of_gifts.htm&release=254&type=5).
* At this time, you cannot create Gift Entry templates. The ability to add and use templates was announced at Dreamforce '24 and is on the roadmap for the second half of 2025.

## Gift Batching
* To remove an entry from a batch, edit from the entry page. Using delete from the batch screen will delete the entry entirely.
* "Set as Default" checkbox will autofill all fields exactly as set (including donor information) for each gift. Default will remain even if you exit and then return to the batch.

## Gift Designations
* Be aware of [the inheritance hierarchy for Gift Designations](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sfdo.npc_fr_manage_designations.htm&type=5).

## Deleting 
* Deleting a Gift Entry does not automatically delete the related Gift Transaction.  The transaction must be deleted separately.

## Other
* Default automation: Transaction status will be “pending” after entry, except for a cash payment, which will have a status of “paid”.
