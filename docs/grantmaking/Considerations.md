# Coming Soon!!

This document will guide you through mapping your organization’s grantmaking process in service of aligning your needs with the available functionality of NPC Grantmaking. Upon completing this document, you should be able to have a deeper understanding of which of the NPC Grantmaking use cases are applicable to your organization. These use cases can then help serve as guidance for key configuration needs for NPC Grantmaking.

(The Grantmaking group will continue work on this document at the January 2026 Virtual Sprint)
