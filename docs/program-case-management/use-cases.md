# Program Management Use Cases
For nonprofits, program data can be collected, tracked, and managed in multiple ways, often requiring different structures and workflows. The Program Management Use Cases outlined here serve as a guide to help nonprofits effectively document and monitor their program activities within Salesforceâ€™s Nonprofit Cloud. 

We acknowledge that each nonprofit operates with unique processes and may require specific customizations to align Salesforce with their programmatic needs. If this is the first time you are setting up Program Management for your org, we recommend working using documentation like the <a href="https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/npc-best-practices/program-case-management/">Program Management Mapping Deck</a> to determine your program structure in Salesforce.
