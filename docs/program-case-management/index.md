## Program Management Mapping Deck

[Download Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RoWxriy8RJ8nDqHDBa06gJ3Qs-cIz1Hr/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116934493408250052558&rtpof=true&sd=true)

This slide deck provides guidance on how to map your programs and benefits to Program Management (PM) in Nonprofit Cloud (NPC). In it you’ll find exercises, definitions, and common use cases to help you configure Program Management to capture the program data you need.

It’s important to complete these mapping exercises before you begin configuring Program Management so you can capture the data you need from the start. 

This slide deck should also be used by organizations planning on implementing the Nonprofit Cloud Case Management, which also uses the Program Management data model.
