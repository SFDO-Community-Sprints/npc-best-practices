# Project Overview
## Vision & Goals
When the Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP) v3 was released almost 10 years ago, it did not have many of the features and settings we are familiar with today. There were no Opportunity record types, NPSP settings were not optimized, many of the defaults we take for granted were just not there. It took a while to get community vetted best practices in place and create the NPSP we know today. Nonprofit Cloud (NPC), Salesforceâ€™s new product offering for nonprofits, is in a similar place. It was released in 2023 and the fundraising component for it just went live in mid-October. It does not have any community best practices or guidance like NPSP does - yet!
